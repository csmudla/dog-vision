About This Project: üêï

    In this repository, you can find a machine learning model designed to recognize 120 different dog breeds from images. 
    Using the magic of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), this model is trained to spot the subtle differences between various breeds.

Tech Stack:

    Python: The primary language of this project.

    TensorFlow & Keras: Powering the machine learning magic.
